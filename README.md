I'm Moises, just a guy with a computer, internet connection, and way too much curiosity for my own good. I hold the delusion that this is all you really need to start making cool stuff.

Building and learning new things is a constant drive. Sitting at my desktop with a new idea truly feels like **the only limit is my imagination** and I have all the power in my hands - a keyboard - to code whatever comes to mind, and perhaps being this *naive* is what truly helps push through the **pain** behind programming and tackling new projects.

Hopefully, spending half a lifetime opening a code editor will help keep the brain from ageing too quickly (or that's what I'll keep telling myself).
