# Hey! 👋

I'm Moises — just a guy with a PC that is too curious to stop creating stuff with it.

Right now, I’m deep into **web development** and always picking up side projects for fun (and to keep leveling up). It’s all about experimenting, learning, and stitching together ideas into working things.

## About Me 🙋‍♂️

* **Technical Service Manager @ Stack Overflow** — mostly working on dev projects, APIs, and integrations.
* **Fullstack Web Dev** — keeping it clean, simple, secure, and fast in a world of bloated SPAs.
* **Project Explorer** — Learning by doing—working on projects like Minecraft Server management, creating internal and custom plugins, and setting up CI/CD workflows.
* Big fan of learning by doing, and sharing what I figure out along the way.

## Recent Projects I’m Proud Of 🖥️

* [Backstage + Stack Overflow for Teams integration](https://github.com/StackExchange/backstage-stackoverflow)
