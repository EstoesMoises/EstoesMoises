I'm Moisés, someone with a computer, internet connection, and far too much curiosity for his own good. I'm convinced that's all you really need to start building cool things. 

Building and learning new things is a constant drive. Sitting at my desktop with a new idea truly feels like the only limit is my imagination and I have all the power in my hands - a keyboard - to code whatever comes to mind. 

Maybe a bit of reckless optimism is what makes starting ambitious projects possible in the first place ;)
