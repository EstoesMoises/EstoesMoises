I'm Moises. Just a guy with a PC that is too curious to stop creating stuff with it.

## About Me

* **Technical Service Manager @ Stack Overflow** improving customer-facing technical operations.
* **Fullstack Web Dev** keeping it clean, simple, secure, and fast in a world of bloated SPAs.
* **Project Explorer** learning by doing. Working on projects like Minecraft Server management, creating internal and custom plugins, and setting up CI/CD workflows.
* Big fan of learning by doing, and sharing what I figure out along the way.

## Recent Projects I’m Proud Of

* [Backstage + Stack Overflow for Teams integration](https://github.com/StackExchange/backstage-stackoverflow)
* [TorkenCraft Minecraft Server](https://torkencraft.es/)
