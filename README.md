I'm Moises. Just a guy with a PC that is too curious to stop creating stuff with it.

Currently working as a **Technical Service Manager** @ **[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)**, where AI learns all the marvelous code that powers my daily frustration when I go on a vibe-coding spree. I'm tasked with improving customer-facing technical operations and just do things that I believe are cool :D (it seems to work).

Building and learning new things is a constant drive. Sitting at my desktop with a new idea truly feels like **the only limit is imagination** and I have all the power in my hands a keyboard to code whatever comes to mind and perhaps being this *naive* is what truly helps push through the **pain** behind programming and tackling new projects.

Hopefully, spending half a lifetime opening a code editor will help keep the brain from aging too quickly (or that's what I'll keep telling myself).
