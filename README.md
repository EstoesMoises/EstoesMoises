# Hi!👋

I'm Moises, just a guy with a PC that is too curious to stop creating stuff with it. 

I'm now hands-on and invested in Web Development while also taking on other types of projects for fun (and to sharpen my skills). My journey is all about exploring, experimenting, and building a strong foundation while putting together the pieces of programming.

## About Me 🙋‍♂️

- I'm currently working as a **Technical Support Engineer** at **Stack Overflow**. With a focus on development projects related to integrations and APIs.
- **Fullstack Web Development**: all things web. Focused on learning to keep things 'simple' in a world of heavily loaded SPAs, secure and performant.
- **Project Explorer**: Learning by doing—working on projects like Minecraft Server management, creating internal and custom plugins, and setting up CI/CD workflows.
- **Learning is sharing, 100%**: Continuously growing through hands-on experience and engaging with the community.
